        "This project demonstrates how to build a powerful and fact-checked chatbot using the **Gemini API** and **Google Search Grounding**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The chatbot, named **Devi**, is specifically designed to answer questions about the **Sri Lalithambigai Temple (UK)**. By using Google Search grounded only on the temple's official website, we ensure that all factual responses are up-to-date and directly sourced.\n",

        "To run the chatbot, you must secure your **Gemini API Key** and set it as an environment variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Get Key:** Visit Google AI Studio and generate your API Key.\n",
        "2.  **Set Environment Variable in Colab:** Run the following two cells, pasting your API key into the `userdata.get()` function when prompted.\n",

        "## 🛠️ **Key Technical Features**\n",
        "\n",
        "### **1. Google Search Grounding (`tools`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "The core feature of this chatbot is the use of the `tools` property in the API call, which activates the **Google Search** tool.\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Reliability:** Answers are generated based on real-time web search results.\n",
        "  * **Specificity:** The user's query is programmatically augmented with the `site:srilalithambigaitemple.co.uk` operator to ensure the search is constrained to the temple's official domain, maximizing the relevance of the grounding data.\n",
        "  * **Citations:** The code extracts and displays the **source URIs** and titles (citations) used by the model, allowing users to verify the information.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **2. System Instruction (`systemInstruction`)**\n",
        "\n",
        "A clear system instruction is used to define the model's persona and rules of engagement:\n",
        "\n",
        "  * **Role:** Act as 'Devi', the knowledgeable bot for the Sri Lalithambigai Temple.\n",
        "  * **Rule:** **Only** use information from the provided search results/website.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Exponential Backoff**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `generateContentWithRetry` function includes an **exponential backoff mechanism** to handle transient network issues or rate-limiting (429 errors), making the application more robust.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**What is Exponential Backoff?**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Exponential backoff** is a standard strategy for managing failures when making repeated requests to a networked service or API. It's an algorithm that determines how long a client should wait before retrying a failed request, with the crucial feature that the wait time gets **longer** with each subsequent failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Why We Use It**\n",
        "\n",
        "When an application fails to connect to a service (like the Gemini API) it's often due to a **transient error**. These temporary issues include:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Rate Limiting (429 Error):** The client has exceeded the service's allowed number of requests per time window.\n",
        "2.  **Server Overload/Congestion:** The API server is temporarily too busy to process the request.\n",
        "3.  **Network Instability:** A brief, temporary drop or slowdown in network connectivity.\n",
        "\n",
        "If the client immediately retries after a failure, it simply adds more load to the already struggling server, often guaranteeing the next attempt will also fail. Exponential backoff ensures the client \"backs off\" by waiting an appropriate amount of time, giving the server a chance to recover.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**The \"Exponential\" Calculation**\n",
        "\n",
        "The term \"exponential\" refers to how the delay is calculated. Instead of adding a fixed amount of time (linear backoff), the wait time **multiplies** with each attempt.\n",
        "\n",
        "The most common formula uses a base of 2, raised to the power of the attempt number. This creates a geometrically increasing delay:\n",
        "\n",
        "| Attempt (n) | Wait Time Formula (Seconds) | Delay |\n",
        "| :---------: | :-------------------------: | :---: |\n",
        "| 1           | $2^{1-1} = 2^0$             | 1 sec |\n",
        "| 2           | $2^{2-1} = 2^1$             | 2 sec |\n",
        "| 3           | $2^{3-1} = 2^2$             | 4 sec |\n",
        "| 4           | $2^{4-1} = 2^3$             | 8 sec |\n",
        "| 5           | $2^{5-1} = 2^4$             | 16 sec|\n",
        "\n",
        "This rapid increase in wait time is highly effective. If an issue is going to resolve, it typically resolves within the first few seconds. If it's still failing after 16 seconds, it's likely a persistent issue that retrying won't fix.\n",
        "\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "**Role in `generateContentWithRetry`**\n",
        "\n",
        "The `generateContentWithRetry` function leverages this pattern to make your application resilient:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  The function initiates a `try...except` block to make the API call.\n",
        "2.  If an exception (failure) is caught, the code calculates the delay using the exponential formula and pauses execution using a `sleep` function.\n",
        "3.  The loop continues up to a defined maximum number of attempts (e.g., 5).\n",
        "4.  If a request succeeds, the loop is exited immediately, providing the result. If all attempts fail, an error message is returned to the user, confirming the persistent failure.\n",
        "\n",
        "This makes the chatbot much more reliable in the real world.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "## 🖥️ **Usage**\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Run the Code:** Execute the `temple_chatbot_detailed.py` file or run from notebook environment.\n",
        "2.  **Start Chatting:** Ask questions related to the temple, such as:\n",
        "      * `What are the opening hours?`\n",
        "      * `When is the next major event?`\n",
        "      * `What is the history of the temple?`\n",
        "      * `Can I book a pooja online?`\n",
        "3.  **Exit:** Type `quit` or `exit` or `bye` or `terminate`.\n",

        "2.  **Query Augmentation:** The user's original `prompt` is programmatically combined with a Google Search `site:` operator (`site:srilalithambigaitemple.co.uk`) and the temple's name. This ensures the model's grounding search is restricted to the specific official website for accurate, relevant information.\n",

        "* If the request fails (e.g., due to a 429 rate limit or network error), it waits for a calculated time (`2 ** attempt`) before retrying. This \"exponential backoff\" mechanism significantly increases the reliability of the application under varying network conditions.\n",
