        "\n",
        "The objective of this project is to build a **classification model** to predict whether a customer will **churn** (leave the bank) or not. This is a crucial business problem as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. We will use a dataset with various customer attributes to train a model that can identify customers at risk of churning, allowing for proactive intervention.\n",
        "\n",
        "The process will follow a standard machine learning workflow:\n",
        "1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** We'll start by exploring the data to understand the distribution of variables, identify any relationships, and check for imbalances in our target variable (`churn`).\n",
        "2.  **Data Pre-processing:** This is a critical step where we'll clean and transform the data. This includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features to prepare them for the model.\n",
        "3.  **Model Building:** We'll select and train a suitable classification algorithm (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest) on our prepared data.\n",
        "4.  **Evaluation:** We'll evaluate our model's performance using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and a confusion matrix to understand how well it predicts customer churn.\n",
        "\n",
        "**NOTE : We'll use `plotly` for data visualisations**\n",

Because there are some `NaN` (missing) values, Pandas typically defaults to a `numeric` type that can handle floating-point numbers, such as `float64`. It treats the city codes `187`, `146`, etc., as numerical values, not as categorical labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "The issue arises when you get to the **model training** phase. Most machine learning models, especially those from libraries like Scikit-learn, require all input features to be numerical. You'll need to use a technique like **One-Hot Encoding** to convert these categorical columns into a numerical format that the model can understand.\n",

        "**The Problem with Not Converting `city`**  \n",
        "If you don't explicitly convert `city` to an `object` type, it will be treated as a numerical column. When you apply **One-Hot Encoding** to your features, you'll be telling the encoder to operate on the `gender` and `occupation` columns (which are correctly identified as categorical), but it will skip the city column because it's a float.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model will then see the city numbers as a continuous, ordered variable. For example, it might incorrectly assume that a city with a code of `500` is \"greater than\" a city with a code of `100`, and that this numerical difference has some predictive meaning. This is a fundamental misunderstanding of the data, as these codes are just arbitrary labels, not values.\n",

        "If we didn't one-hot encode the `city` column, the model would interpret it as **continuous numerical data**. It might, for example, assign a higher weight to city codes with larger numbers, which makes no sense from a business or a data perspective. The model would think there's a **linear relationship** where there isn't one. This can lead to the model making incorrect predictions and can hurt its overall performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "One-hot encoding solves this problem by creating a new binary column for each unique city code. For example, instead of a single `city` column with values like `146` or `187`, you would get new columns like `city_146`, `city_187`, etc. A value of 1 in city_146 would indicate that the customer is from that city, and 0 otherwise.\n",
        "\n",

        "**One-hot encoding** the `city` column will create a large number of new features, one for each unique city code. This can potentially lead to a less efficient model and may cause issues like overfitting, where the model learns the training data too well but struggles to generalize to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, despite this, it's a necessary step because the alternative is much worse. If we treat the `city` codes as a single numerical column, the model would assume that the distance between city `100` and `200` is the same as the distance between city `500` and `600`, which is not true. These numbers are just arbitrary labels. **One-hot encoding** avoids this fundamental and incorrect assumption by treating each city as a separate, distinct entity.\n",
        "\n",
        "For this assignment, the trade-off is worth it because it ensures the model correctly interprets the data. In more complex real-world scenarios with thousands of unique cities, you might explore techniques like **dimensionality reduction after one-hot encoding** to address the issue."

        "The heatmap on the left, \"Retained Customers (Churn=0)\", reveals that the bank's retained customer base is not evenly distributed. Instead, it is highly concentrated in specific segments. The brightest yellow hotspots, indicating the highest customer counts, are primarily within customer_nw_category 2. This category represents the bank's core and most stable customer demographic, with particularly strong performance in some branches.\n",

        "**2. Churn Distribution**\n",
        "The \"Churned Customers (Churn Status = Churned)\" heatmap on the right presents a stark contrast. There are no large, bright hotspots. While some areas are darker than others, indicating a higher number of churned customers, the overall pattern is one of wide dispersion. The churn appears to be a consistent, low-to-moderate-level issue spread across many different branches and net worth categories.\n",

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The data suggests that a solution to the churn problem may not be to fix a single branch or customer type, but to implement a more general strategy aimed at improving overall customer experience and increasing the perceived value of banking with this institution. This might include enhancing digital services, improving customer support, or offering more personalized financial products to a wider audience."
