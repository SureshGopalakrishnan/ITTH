# Linear Regression: Insurance Charges Prediction

### Assignment Overview

This assignment builds a **Multiple Linear Regression model** to predict insurance costs (`charges`) based on various personal attributes of a beneficiary.
This process demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, starting from initial data exploration and preprocessing, and culminating in model training and evaluation.

### Code Structure

The Python script is organized into the following logical sections to ensure a clear and reproducible workflow. Each section is a critical step in the machine learning process:

1.  **Data Loading and Initial Exploration**
    * **Libraries**  
      The assignment begins by importing essential data science libraries like `pandas` for data manipulation, `numpy` for numerical operations, `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for data visualization, and `sklearn` for machine learning tasks.
    * **Data Import**  
      The `insurance.csv` dataset is loaded into a pandas DataFrame.
    * **Initial Checks**  
      The script uses `.head()` to display the first few rows, `.info()` to check data types and identify any non-null values, and `.describe()` to view basic statistical summaries of the numerical features.

2.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
    This section focuses on understanding the relationships and distributions within the data using a variety of plots.
    * **Pairplot**  
      A `seaborn.pairplot` is used to visualize the pairwise relationships and distributions of the numerical features (`age`, `bmi`, `charges`).
    * **Distribution Plots**  
      Histograms and box plots (`seaborn.histplot` and `seaborn.boxplot`) are used to inspect the distribution of features and identify potential outliers.
    * **Categorical Analysis**  
      The relationship between categorical variables (`sex`, `smoker`, `region`) and the target variable (`charges`) is explored using `seaborn.countplot` and `seaborn.boxplot`.

3.  **Data Preprocessing**
    * **Handling Categorical Variables**  
      The categorical features (`sex`, `smoker`, `region`) are transformed into a numerical format that the linear model can understand using **One-Hot Encoding** via `pd.get_dummies()`. This creates new binary columns for each category.
    * **Feature Scaling**  
      The numerical features (`age`, `bmi`) are standardized using `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn. This step is crucial to ensure that features with different scales do not disproportionately influence the model's performance. The mean of each scaled feature will be close to 0, and the standard deviation will be close to 1.

4.  **Model Building**
    * **Data Splitting**  
      The preprocessed dataset is partitioned into **training** and **testing sets** using `train_test_split` with a test size of 20%. This ensures an unbiased evaluation of the model's performance on unseen data.
    * **Model Training**  
      An instance of the `LinearRegression` model is initialized and then trained by calling the `.fit()` method on the scaled training data.

5.  **Model Evaluation**
    The performance of the trained model is assessed using several key metrics.
    * **Prediction**  
      The model makes predictions on the test set using `.predict()`.
    * **Performance Metrics**  
      The script calculates **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**, **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**, and **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** to measure the magnitude of the errors.
    * **R-squared ($R^2$) Score**  
      The model's overall fit is assessed using the $R^2$ score, which indicates the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
    * **Residual Plot**  
      A plot of the residual errors (`y_predicted - y_test`) is generated to visually inspect the model's performance. The presence of distinct clusters of errors in this plot suggests that the model is performing inconsistently across different subgroups within the data.

### Next Steps / Improvements

The current model is a strong starting point, but the residual plot suggests a significant opportunity for improvement. The clear clustering of errors is likely caused by the different charge patterns of smokers versus non-smokers.

* **Create Group-Specific Models**  
  The most impactful next step would be to **train separate linear regression models for smokers and non-smokers.** This would allow each model to learn the unique relationships between features and charges for its specific group, significantly improving prediction accuracy.
  Not sure how practical this would be
* **Feature Engineering**  
  Explore creating new features, such as interaction terms between existing variables (e.g., `age` * `bmi` or `age` * `smoker`), to see if they can capture more complex relationships.
* **Outlier Handling**  
  Add some outlier handling to reduce residual errors
* **Alternative Models**  
  Consider trying other regression models like **Lasso or Ridge Regression**, which can handle multicollinearity and overfitting better than a simple linear model.
