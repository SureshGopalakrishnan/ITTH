        "The primary objective of this project is to build a **Linear Regression model** to predict insurance costs (`charges`) based on various personal attributes of a beneficiary. This is a classic supervised machine learning problem where we will use a set of features (age, sex, BMI, etc.) to predict a continuous target variable (`charges`).\n",

        "The process will involve:\n",
        "1.  **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understanding the distribution of our data and identifying relationships between variables.\n",
        "2.  **Data Preprocessing:** Handling categorical variables and preparing the data for the model.\n",
        "3.  **Model Training:** Splitting the data and training a Linear Regression model.\n",

You can instantly see patterns, distributions, and potential relationships between different categories and your target variable.

        "\n",
        "* **Smokers (Blue Data Points)**  \n",
        "This group is responsible for the dramatic, higher-end insurance charges. The graph reveals a **strong positive correlation** between BMI and cost for smokers. As their BMI increases, their insurance charges escalate significantly, with many data points reaching over 30,000. This demonstrates that for smokers, both BMI and their smoking habit combine to drive up costs considerably.\n",
        "* **Non-Smokers (Green Data Points)**  \n",
        "In stark contrast, this group is clustered at the lower end of the cost spectrum. The green data points show consistently lower insurance charges, rarely exceeding 15,000. While there might be a slight upward trend in costs as BMI increases, the effect is minor compared to the impact of smoking.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the graph illustrates a clear divide between the two groups. The non-smokers have relatively stable, low insurance costs, while the smokers face significantly higher and more volatile charges, especially as their BMI rises. The simple fact of being a smoker appears to be a major determinant of insurance cost."

If we scaled `y`, our model would output a scaled value, which would be completely uninterpretable. For example, a **prediction of 0.5** would have no direct meaning. To make it meaningful, we would have to \"un-scale\" the prediction back to its original units.\n",

        "Keeping the dependent variable in its original units simplifies the entire process. The model's predictions are directly comparable to the real-world values, and the model's coefficients are immediately interpretable.
