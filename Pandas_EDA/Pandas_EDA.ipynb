        "- **`has_children`**: A simple binary flag (`True`/`False`) to indicate if the booking includes any children or babies. This is useful for analyzing family-specific trends.\n",
        "- **`total_previous_bookings`**: The sum of `previous_cancellations` and `previous_bookings_not_canceled` to get a complete history of the customer's booking behavior.\n",
