### **Practical Guide to NumPy Statements**

This program is a guide to fundamental NumPy concepts, covering array creation, slicing, matrix operations, and an in-depth explanation of broadcasting.

**Key Concepts**
* **1D and 2D Array Creation**  
  Demonstrates creating arrays from a range of values and reshaping a 1D array into a 2D array
* **Slicing and Indexing**  
  Examples of extracting specific elements, getting every other element, and reversing an array using slicing
* **Matrix Operations**  
  Shows how to perform element-wise addition and multiplication, as well as matrix multiplication using the `@` and `np.dot()` operators
* **Broadcasting**  
  An in-depth section with an explanation, rules, and examples of how NumPy automatically performs operations on arrays of different shapes
* **Statistical Computations**  
  Includes examples of calculating the mean, median, standard deviation, maximum and minimum scores of a NumPy array
