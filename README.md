ITTH - AI Engineering Course Works, Assignments and Projects

This repository contains my class work, projects, and assignments for an AI Engineering course. The assignments are structured to follow the curriculum, from Foundational Data Science and Statistics to advanced topics in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Generative AI.

COURSE OVERVIEW

Step into the world of AI Engineering, where Data meets Intelligence.

This field blends core disciplines like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science to build solutions that learn and adapt. From Deep Learning models and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image recognition to Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Transformers powering todayâ€™s Large Language Models (LLMs), the possibilities are endless.
